# This file defines which processes should be included in the calculator model,
# and which objects should be given "markets" (i.e. mass balanced).
#
# Objects that occur in the process recipes but which don't have "markets" are
# like elementary flows in LCA -- they can come and go, but a process consuming
# them doesn't have any knock-on implications for other processes in the model.
